			Just the right amount of everything.
			A new dual‑camera system captures more of what you see and love. The fastest chip ever in a smartphone and all‑day battery life let you do more and charge less. And the highest‑quality video in a smartphone, so your memories look better than ever.
			<h3>Camera </h3>
			All‑new dual‑camera system. Take your photos from wide to ultra wide. A redesigned interface uses the new Ultra Wide camera to show you what’s happening outside the frame — and lets you capture it. Shoot and edit videos as easily as you do photos. It’s the world’s most popular camera, now with a whole new perspective.The new 12MP Wide sensor has 100 percent Focus Pixels for up to three times faster autofocus in low light.The 12MP Ultra Wide can capture four times more scene, it’s great for landscapes, travel, groups, large interiors, and action shots. Shoot and edit the highest-quality video in a smartphone. iPhone 11 shoots beautifully sharp 4K video at 60 fps across all its cameras. The Ultra Wide camera captures four times more scene, so it’s perfect for action shots like your dog catching a frisbee. If you’re recording a performance — say, your kid’s piano recital — when you zoom in, the audio zooms too. And now you can edit videos as easily as you do photos. Introducing Night mode. Shooting in low light doesn’t have to be a shot in the dark. Night mode is a new feature that turns on automatically for low‑light photos like you’ve never seen. There’s no need for flash, colors are more natural, and photos are brighter. Take portraits to new places. With new kinds of portraits and more lighting controls, the dual cameras in iPhone 11 work together to create stunning images. And Portrait mode now works with everything you love to shoot — that includes your best friends, two‑legged or four.
			<h3>Display</h3>
			<b>Liquid Retina LCD.</b> The true-to-life all-screen design makes everything look amazing.
			<br>
			<b>True Tone.</b> Adjusts the white balance to match the color temperature of the light around you.
			<br>
			<b>Tap or raise to wake.</b> Your iPhone is ready in an instant.<br>
			<b>Haptic Touch.</b> Do all kinds of essential things faster with contextual menus and shortcuts.

 			<h3>Chip</h3>
 			Both iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro have the fastest chip ever in a smartphone. A13 Bionic is so powerful, everything you do is fast and fluid. It also works in the most power‑efficient way possible, so your battery lasts longer. In fact, A13 Bionic is so advanced, it’s years ahead of the pack..
 			<h3>Features</h3>
 			<h4>Face ID</h4>
 			The most secure facial authentication in a smartphone. Face ID lets you unlock your iPhone instantly, and it’s even more secure than Touch ID. With just a glance you can sign in to apps, access accounts, and pay with Apple Pay. And setting it up is quick and simple.
 			<h4>Privacy</h4>
 			Every feature in iPhone is designed to protect your personal information. Face ID doesn’t store or share your photo. When you send an iMessage or make a FaceTime call, your data is encrypted. And Maps tells you where you’re going without sharing where you’ve been.
 			<h4>Sharing</h4>
 			Ultra Wideband technology comes to iPhone. The new Apple‑designed U1 chip uses Ultra Wideband technology for spatial awareness — allowing iPhone 11 to understand its precise location relative to other nearby U1‑equipped Apple devices. Think GPS at the scale of your living room. So if you want to share a file with someone using AirDrop, just point your iPhone at theirs and they’ll be first on the list.
