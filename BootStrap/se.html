			iPhone SE packs our most powerful chip into our most popular size at our most affordable price. It’s just what you’ve been waiting for.
			<h3>Camera </h3>
			The advanced camera system with A13 Bionic brings you Portrait mode, which artfully blurs the background to put the focus on your subject — even when you’re taking selfies. <b>Depth Control</b>. A simple slider lets you blur the background as much or as little as you like — before or after you take the photo. <b>Portrait Lighting</b>. Choose from six studio‑quality effects, then adjust the lighting intensity to show your subject in the best possible light.Next‑generation Smart HDR knows a face when it sees one, and intelligently relights it to capture more natural-looking contours and skin tones. It also finesses highlight and shadow detail in the background. So every part of your photo looks amazing.4K video means you’ll see four times more detail than in 1080p HD video. And extended dynamic range adds greater detail in highlights and shadows.



			<h3>Display</h3>
			Touch ID lets you securely unlock your iPhone and sign in
			to apps instantly. You can even use it with Apple Pay to grab a coffee, get a yoga app, or shop for sneakers online.
			All without reaching for your credit card.
 			<h3>Chip</h3>
 			We custom‑built A13 Bionic with a focus on machine learning across the entire chip — enabling experiences that simply aren’t found on any other smartphone. In fact, it’s so fast, so powerful, and so intelligent, it’s years ahead of any other chip. Which gives you an unfair advantage. We put the brains of iPhone 11 Pro in the body of iPhone SE. A13 Bionic is the fastest chip ever in a smartphone, period. So everything feels fluid, whether you're launching apps, playing the latest games, or exploring new ways to work and play with augmented reality.
